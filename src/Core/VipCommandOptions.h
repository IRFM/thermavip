/// \class VipCommandOptions
///
/// \brief The VipCommandOptions class is a Parser for command-line options
///
/// It is provided for Qt < 6 versions, where QCommandLineParser is not available.
///
/// This class is used by applications that need to accept command-line arguments.  It can
/// also automatically generate help text, which keeps it from accidentally falling out of
/// sync with the supported options, and it can produce warnings for common errors.
///
/// It accepts Windows-style ("/option"), UNIX-style ("-option"), and GNU-style
/// ("--option") options. By default, VipCommandOptions uses Windows-style options
/// (VipCommandOptions::Slash) on Windows and GNU-style options (VipCommandOptions::DoubleDash)
/// on UNIX and Mac. When using GNU-style options, single-character option names only
/// require a single leading dash and can be grouped together, for example, "-abc".
///
/// VipAny parameter that does not start with the option prefix is considered a positional
/// parameter. Most applications treat positional parameters as filenames. When using
/// GNU- or UNIX-style options, use a double dash ("--") alone to force the remaining
/// parameters to be interpreted as positional parameters.
///
/// To use VipCommandOptions, first add the supported options using the add() and alias()
/// methods, then process the command line using the parse() method, and finally retrieve
/// the processed options using the positional(), count(), value() and/or parameters()
/// methods.
///
/// Mutually-exclusive options can be specified by using the \a group parameter to add().
/// Only one option in a group will be accepted on the command line; if multiple options
/// are provided, only the last one takes effect.
///
/// Some options may accept an optional or required parameter. Depending on the value
/// of the paramStyle() property, the parameter may be separated from the option by
/// an equals sign ("/option=value") or by a space ("-option value"). By default,
/// Windows uses an equals sign and UNIX and Mac accept both an equals sign and a
/// space. Optional parameters always require an equals sign. Note that, when using
/// GNU-style options, single-character options cannot have optional parameters.
///
/// A simple archiving application might use code similar to this:
/// \code
/// VipCommandOptions options;
/// options.add("compress", "create a new archive");
/// options.alias("compress", "c");
/// options.add("extract", "extract files from an archive");
/// options.alias("extract", "x");
/// options.add("level", "set the compression level (0-9)", VipCommandOptions::Required);
/// options.alias("level", "l");
/// options.add("verbose", "show more information about the process; specify twice for more detail", VipCommandOptions::AllowMultiple);
/// options.alias("verbose", "v");
/// options.add("help", "show this help text");
/// options.alias("help", "h");
/// options.parse(QCoreApplication::arguments());
/// if(options.count("help") || options.showUnrecognizedWarning()) {
/// options.showUsage();
/// return -1;
/// }
/// bool verbose = options.count("verbose");
/// int level = 5;
/// if(options.count("level")) {
/// level = options.value("level").toInt();
/// }
/// \endcode
