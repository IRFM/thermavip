- "Player properties" panel: properties are not necessarily sorted by alphabetical order

- FFmpeg: add the possibility to record in a video the Thermavip interface.

- UDA: when connecting to a different UDA server, previous servers are displayed in a list
to avoid typing them
- UDA: default decimation value is 1000 (instead of 5000 previously)


Thermavip v2.2.7 - 22/09/2018

- Updated skins and icons
- Histogram extraction speedup.
- Extracting a histogram or values along polyline now ask for
the way to extract image components if needed: ARGB, complex real/imag,...
- Moved ROI related information (size, area, min, max,...) to the
"Player properties" tool widget.
- Added new information in the "Player properties" tool widget (curve's min,
max..., histogram min, max..., image statistics...).
- Removed ROI statistics from the ROI editor (moved to "Player properties")
- Added a tool bar button for video players to disable image updates (freeze image)
- Added a tool bar button for video players to use an adjusted color map based 
on the image histogram.
- Processing list: processing can now be copied/cutted/pasted.
- Plot player: it is now possible to zoom with the wheel only vertically or
horizontally.
- Corrected linux bug where tool widgets were not properly raised on top
of the main GUI.
- Plot player: added a new time scale mode where the scale displays 
the elapsed time since the left date of the scale.
- Plot player: enable mouse zooming from outside the scale area.
- Plot player: optimized symbol drawing for curves.
- Plot player: fixed wrong automatic scale for histograms.

- UDA: Added millisecond precision for the time interval selection, possibility to copy/paste time in ns

- UDA: display information signal (max, min, number of points,..) and display them in the "Player properties" panel

- UDA: added spin box to modify the decimation factor per player



Thermavip v2.2.6 - 01/09/2018

- Updated skins, modified icons
- Optimized archive file writer to avoid too much memory usage

- Now apply the image transformations (cropping, rotation,...) to the drawn ROIs
- Added possibility to apply a y offset to all curves in order to have the minimum y value at 0
- Optimized curve drawing (once again)
- Corrected tool tip behavior when the mouse hover the tool tip
- Added CHANGELOG.txt in about dialog box
- Enhanced the drag & drop of plot items
- Added the possibility to copy/paste signals/images/ROIs
- Optimized the curve/signal/image display, mainly for streaming
- ROI display: by default the ROI text color depends on the background color
- Changed the behavior of the time scale in plot player. Now, the
start date always corresponds to the minimum y value of all curves.
- Lot of minor corrections/enhancement in players
- Added the possibility to extract time trace on multiple ROIs using:
the union shape, the intersection shape or extract all shapes independently.
- Added possibility to display date time on plot player time scale

- Python: Enhanced curve fitting

- UDA: Now zooming on a curve or changing the time scale will reload the signal for given time range
- UDA: The user can change the decimation strategy for each plot player
- UDA: Added a UDA settings page to change the server address, the decimation value and decimation strategy

-Modified the dark skin and added several icons.
-Corrected the image cropping method for RGB images with transparancy
-Optimize VipBinaryArchive to avoid too much memory allocation

-Several corrections/optimizations
-Reshaping of the "Directory browser" tool widget
-Reshaping of the "Player properties" tool widget
-Reshaping of the "Player list" tool widget
-Moved the streaming button in the workspace tab bar
-Corrected the session loading bug on linux
-Changed axes titles and curves titles are now kept as expected
-Add options to change the default curve look & feel
-Add a new tool tip mode for plot players. A time marker can be visible on all other
players to ease the multi player analysis.
-Several small GUI enhancement
-Relocating the UDA data base is now saved in the session file. 
-Simplification of the interface.
